**My experience with Full Stack Development**  
  
I have been working on the development of a Full Stack Application for CIS 486. My application needs work and refinement, but this is what I can tell you about full stack development so far. I have learned that **Git** is a very valuable tool. It is a version control system that tracks the changes of the code you are working on. For CIS/CS students, this is a neat tool that will help you out tremendously. It is so helpful because we are usually working with the school's dev box. By using git, we can push our changes up to the cloud essentially. This allows us to clone a repository and work on any machine. I've had to self handoff before by giving my self notes through code comments. Reminding my future self what specific code means or code that needs to be implemented in the future. Concerning Full Stack Development, I have also learned that building a working application is a process. It takes time to make a project that you are proud of.

**My definition of Agile Handoffs**

In my opinion, Agile Handoffs are like a building massive LEGO sets. Even though Agile development is more about adaptation than following set instructions, LEGOS still come to mind. I picture a large development project that is going to take much longer than a day to complete. With each handoff, I am implementing more requirements and polishing my full stack application overall. Just like with LEGO sets, I am handing off a more completed version of the product to myself or a project collaborator. Self handoffs are important because it allows us to break our large projects into smaller sections. Also, these handoffs are important because most of the time we are focusing on only a few requirements at that given moment. Our future selves will be implementing different requirements. 

Handoffs are essential when working with multiple teams that focus on different parts of an application. Here is website that explains the ideal size for [handoffs in agile development](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/new-to-agile-or-scrum/agile-teamwork).
